# Woko IDEA plugin
The plugin allows easy, keyboard-centric navigation in the project's facets.

## Woko tool Window

The Woko tool window shows a list of all facets in the project, in a sortable/filterable table. It allows to find facets easily and to navigate to the code directly.

### Keyboard shortcuts

* ```CTRL-W``` : pops up the tool window and refreshes the facets list. Focuses the filtering text field, so that you can filter out directly by typing some text (substring).

And when the filtering textfield has focus :

* ```CTRL-N``` : sort by facet name
* ```CTRL-P``` : sort by profile
* ```CTRL-T``` : sort by target type
* ```CTRL-F``` : sort by facet class
* ```ARROW UP/DOWN``` : navigate in the table
* ```ENTER``` : open the selected facet class in editor
